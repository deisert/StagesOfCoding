      I had the pleasure to accompany you during your bachelor thesis.
      You went through all the coding moods and I was privileged to watch.
      Clever as I am, I made some screenshots of your mood.
      Here are some of the said examples. <br>
      Enjoy. <br> <br>
      Happy Birthday btw. <br>
      Love you. ‚ù§ üòò
