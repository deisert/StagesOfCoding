      I had the <i>pleasure</i> to accompany you during your bachelor thesis.
      In which You went through all the different coding moods and I was <i>privileged</i> to watch <b>(live)</b>.
      Clever as I am, I made some screenshots along the way.
      Here are some examples. <br>
      I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.<br> <br>
      Happy Birthday btw. <br>
      Love you. ‚ù§ üòò
