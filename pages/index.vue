        I had the <i>pleasure</i> to accompany you during your bachelor thesis.
        In which You went through all the different coding moods and I was <i>privileged</i> to watch <b>(live)</b>.
        Clever as I am, I made some screenshots along the way.
        Here are some examples. <br>
        I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.<br> <br>
        Happy Birthday btw. <br>
        Love you. ‚ù§Ô∏è üòò
